# dxf-fix [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

**dxf-fix** is a Python command-line tool to clean and reconstruct DXF files for photolithography and other precision manufacturing workflows. It flattens arcs and splines into straight segments, snaps nearly-coincident endpoints with micrometer precision, removes duplicate segments, and reconstructs closed, independent shapes using clean `LWPOLYLINE`s.

Many CAD tools export DXF files with curves and loosely connected endpoints, which:
- Prevent proper nesting or shape detection in lithography tools like KLayout, and even more importantly the control softwares that power laser cutters, photoplotters, mask service providers and maskl-less lithography equipment
- Cause rendering artifacts or missing features
- Require manual editing to unify and simplify structures

**dxf-fix** automates the cleanup process and ensures your layout geometry is robust and ready for downstream applications.

## Features

- Flattens `LINE`, `ARC`, `CIRCLE`, `POLYLINE`, and `LWPOLYLINE` entities into line segments
- Snaps endpoints using KD-tree clustering with tunable micrometer precision
- Deduplicates symmetric segments (e.g., (A, B) == (B, A))
- Reconstructs independent closed paths from raw segments
- Outputs clean `LWPOLYLINE`s suitable for fabrication and visualization
- Provides a high-resolution debug overlay image to inspect snapping behavior
- Falls back to saving open paths as `LINE`s when closure is not possible
- Optionally scales and flips the output geometry

## Installation

Install Python 3.9+ and required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install ezdxf matplotlib scipy
```

### Optional: Create an Isolated Environment with Mamba / Micromamba

If you'd prefer to isolate the dependencies using `mamba` or `micromamba`, you can create and activate an environment like this:

```bash
mamba create -n dxf-fix python=3.10 ezdxf matplotlib scipy
mamba activate dxf-fix
```

Then, run the script as usual:

```bash
python fix_dxf.py input.dxf output.dxf
```

## Usage

Run the tool from the command line:

```bash
python fix_dxf.py input.dxf output.dxf
```

- `input.dxf`: input DXF file (e.g., exported from Onshape)
- `output.dxf`: cleaned DXF file with reconstructed shapes

You can configure snapping precision and additional output transformation parameters at the top of the script:

```python
DEFAULT_UNIT = "mm"
DEFAULT_PRECISION_UM = 0.1
DEFAULT_ARC_SEGMENTS = 100
OUTPUT_SCALE = 1.0  # Set to e.g. 0.5 to reduce the size by half
FLIP_Y = False      # Set to True to vertically flip the output
```

These transformation options are useful when:
- Your DXF export is scaled differently (e.g., 2:1 or 10:1)
- You need to mirror the layout vertically for lithography or alignment purposes

## Output

- A cleaned DXF file with closed `LWPOLYLINE`s
- - Any open paths that could not be closed will be written as `LINE`s
- A diagnostic image `reconstruction_overlay.png` showing snapping and open paths, see example below:

## Verification and Editing

We recommend to view the output DXF file visually in the open source [KLayout software](https://www.klayout.de/build.html), also [on GitHub](https://github.com/KLayout/klayout). The viewer hatches closed areas nicely which indicates that lines are indeed closed and ready for the lithography machine or mask service.

You can double check that the final scale in micrometer of features in your file is correct by using the "Ruler" tool to measure an edge of known size.

Switch the software opening mode to "edit mode" in order to delete lables you might not need.
